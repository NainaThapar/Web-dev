This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Ticket-App Overview

Ticket-App is a pilot learning application built with Next.js, incorporating features such as routing, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and a backend using MongoDB with Mongoose.

## Features:

## Next.js Framework:

The application is built with Next.js, a React framework that provides features like server-side rendering, routing, and API routes.

## Routing:

Ticket-App uses Next.js routing for navigating between different pages of the application.
Routes are defined for various functionalities such as viewing all tickets, creating a new ticket, updating ticket details, and deleting a ticket.
CRUD Operations:

The application supports CRUD operations for managing tickets:
**Create Ticket**: Users can create a new ticket by providing details such as title, description, and category.
**Read Ticket**: Tickets can be viewed individually with their details.
**Update Ticket**: Users can edit and update ticket details like title, description, and category.
**Delete Ticket**: Tickets can be deleted from the system.

## Backend with MongoDB and Mongoose:

Ticket-App has a backend powered by MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing ticket data.
Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, is used to define the data schema and interact with the database.
The backend manages the CRUD operations for tickets, ensuring data integrity and persistence.

## Authentication and Authorization (Optional):

For advanced functionality, the application can include user authentication and authorization.
Users can sign up, log in, and access specific routes based on their roles (e.g., admin, regular user).
Authentication can be implemented using libraries like NextAuth.js, Passport.js, or custom JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
